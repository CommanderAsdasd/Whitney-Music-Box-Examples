This is a collection of examples of Whitney Music Boxes.  Some of them are purely visual 
representations of Whitney's "Incremental Drift" concept.  Some use the visual to trigger sounds, and
some produce sound or sound files, only.

The motion graphics used in these examples was developed and popularized by John Whitney (Sr), who 
described it in his 1980 book "Digital Harmony". Whitney's book contained example code in the BASIC 
programming language, written by Paul Rother.

Amazon has a listing for this book here:

The "Whitney Music Box", in which the spiral form of this animation is used to trigger closely 
related musical sounds was created by Jim Bumgardner in 2006. Jim's first blog article can be found here:

The processing/digital_harmony_examples directory contains ports of the sample code from
the book.  The programs have ported in a fairly straightforward manner from BASIC to
Processing.

basic/
  This directory contains the original BASIC examples by Paul Rother.  The program "Column C" is
  the basis for the animation in the Whitney Music Box.
