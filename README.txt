This is a collection of examples of Whitney Music Boxes.  The animation used in these examples
was developed and popularized by John Whitney, who described it in his book "Digital Harmony".
This book contained example code in the BASIC programming language, written by Paul Rother.

The idea of using these animations to trigger closely related musical sounds, in the style of
a music box, was developed by Jim Bumgardner.

The processing/digital_harmony_examples directory contains ports of the sample code from
the book.  The programs have ported in a fairly straightforward manner from BASIC to
Processing.
