This is a collection of examples of Whitney Music Boxes.  Some of them are purely visual 
representations of Whitney's "Incremental Drift" concept.  Some use the visual to trigger sounds, and
some produce sound or sound files, only.

The motion graphics used in these examples was developed and popularized by John Whitney (Sr), who 
described it in his 1980 book "Digital Harmony". Whitney's book contained example code in the BASIC 
programming language, written by Paul Rother.

The "Whitney Music Box", in which the spiral form of this animation is used to trigger closely 
related musical sounds was created by Jim Bumgardner in 2006. Jim's first blog article can be found here:

The processing/digital_harmony_examples directory contains ports of the sample code from
the book.  The programs have ported in a fairly straightforward manner from BASIC to
Processing.

basic/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This directory contains the original BASIC examples by Paul Rother, intended for the Apple II.  
  The program "Column BC" is the basis for the animation in the Whitney Music Box.
  
chuck/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample ChucK version.

flash_actionscript/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample Flash versions which sync to pre-generated audio.

html5/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample HTML5/Canvas version
  
midi/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample MIDI versions, generated by the perl script in the /perl directory.
  
nyquist/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple program for Nyquist, a lisp-based language. Very elegant!
  
pd/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Audio patches for Puredata.

perl/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripts to generate MIDI sequences that match the animation.
  
processing/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;digital_harmony_examples<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ports of Paul Rother's original sample code from the book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;plus_midi<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Versions which trigger MIDI instruments (both rwmidi and midibus libaries)

&nbsp;&nbsp;plus_pd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Versions which talk to PD (puredata) and response to OSC.

&nbsp;&nbsp;plus_pd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Versions which use the BEADS library

&nbsp;&nbsp;visuals_only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Versions which generate visuals only.

pyo/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample pyo version.

sonic_pi/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample versions for Sonic Pi contributed by David Rees

supercollider/<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample versions in Supercollider
